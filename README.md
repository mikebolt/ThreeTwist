#ThreeTwist

ThreeTwist is a JavaScript library for simulating, visualizing, and interacting with 3D twisty puzzles.

ThreeTwist is a continuation of the Cuber project created for Google's Chrome Cube Lab. If you're
interested in the history of the Cuber project, check out [this link](http://stewd.io/w/rubikscube).

The ThreeTwist project has the following goals:

- Fixing issues in the codebase
- Adding new features
- Clearly documenting all of the source code
- Integration with a modern build system
- Thorough unit testing
- Open, community-driven development process

ThreeTwist is licensed under the MIT License included in the LICENSE.md file.

##Downloading

If you have the git CLI installed, just open a terminal and change directories to a directory where you keep stuff like this and run the command

    git clone https://github.com/mikebolt/ThreeTwist

Otherwise, you can download the project as a zip file by [clicking this link or the "Download ZIP" button to the right](https://github.com/mikebolt/ThreeTwist/archive/master.zip).

##Installing

To begin, make sure that you have node.js and npm installed. npm usually comes installed with node.js. [Visit this page for instructions on how to install both](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

Next, open up your terminal and change directories to where you saved the ThreeTwist project directory. Then install the ThreeTwist npm package by running the command

    npm install

This just downloads and saves some npm packages into the node_modules directory. These packages are necessary for building this project.
