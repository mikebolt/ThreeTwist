There were some font files in here, namely:
  Rubik.otf
  Rubik.ttf
  RubikExtended.otf
  RubikExtended.ttf
  
I couldn't be completely sure about the licensing of these fonts, so I removed them.
They have been replaced with the 'rubik' fonts from the Google font project:
https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl

There is a good chance that these are the exact same font files.
